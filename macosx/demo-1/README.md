# demo-1

A simple Mac app that uses AmanithVG, compiled and organized with make, and that uses Rust at the top level and in a callback that the Rust calling code passes to the main C program handler.

This demonstrates most or all of the Rust-C integration needed to build OpenVG-based Mac apps in Rust.
